# Iteration manifest schema

Each `iteration-N/` directory contains a `manifest.json` written by
`run_functional_eval.run_all`. The manifest is the **authoritative** handoff
between scripts in the pipeline — `aggregate_benchmark.py`,
`upload_dashboard.py`, and any other downstream tool **require** it.

The on-disk run dirs remain the ultimate source of truth for per-run results;
the manifest is the index that tells consumers which variants exist, which is
primary/baseline, and where to find each run.

### Field notes

- **`configs`** is the authoritative list of variant directory names for this
  iteration. It comes from the order of `variants[]` in evals.json and gates
  what `aggregate_benchmark` and `upload_dashboard` consider — stray dirs
  (failed-runs/, scratch/) are ignored.
- **`primary_variant` / `baseline_variant`** come from `evals.json`'s
  `defaults` block. They pin the delta direction (`delta = primary - baseline`)
  so reordering variants in evals.json doesn't accidentally invert the sign.
- **`runs[].path`** is always relative to the iteration dir, so manifests are
  movable across machines as long as the on-disk layout travels with them.
- **`runs[]` per-run metrics** (`executor_duration_s`, `tokens`, `pass_rate`,
  …) are derived from each run's `timing.json` + `grading.json` during
  `_refresh_manifest_runs`. They are convenience caches, not the source of
  truth — re-running `run_functional_eval` will recompute them.

## `run_status.json`

Written into each `<run-dir>/` by the executor and grader functions. Used
by `--resume` to decide whether a run can be skipped.

```jsonc
{
  "status": "graded",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-26T12:42:13+00:00",
  "executor_completed_at": "2026-04-26T12:30:00+00:00",
  "grader_completed_at": "2026-04-26T12:42:13+00:00"
}
```

### Status values

| Status     | Meaning                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pending`  | Planned but not yet executed (set in manifest skeleton)           |
| `executed` | Executor exited 0; transcript + outputs present                   |
| `graded`   | Grader exited 0 and `grading.json` exists                         |
| `failed`   | Executor or grader exited non-zero, or timed out                  |

`--resume` decides what to skip from on-disk artifacts, not from the
`status` field — that way a grader failure never forces an unnecessary
executor re-run:

- **Executor phase** skips a run whose `transcript.jsonl` already contains a
  final `result` event (verifiable proof the executor succeeded).
- **Grader phase** skips a run whose `grading.json` exists and parses.

The `status` field is updated to reflect the latest attempt; consult it for
display, not for resume gating.

## Lifecycle

1. **Plan** — `run_all` calls `plan_runs`, then `_build_manifest_skeleton`
   marks every planned run as `pending`. Before writing, the skeleton is
   refreshed against any existing on-disk state so a viewer reading mid-run
   never sees a freshly-blanked manifest. The manifest is written before any
   work starts so a crash mid-run still leaves a discoverable contract.
2. **Execute** — Each worker writes `run_status.json` to its own run dir
   when it finishes (`executed` or `failed`). No worker touches the
   manifest directly — there is no shared lock. After the executor pool
   joins, `run_all` refreshes + rewrites the manifest so the grader phase
   (and any concurrent reader) sees real status.
3. **Grade** — Only runs with a usable `transcript.jsonl` are queued; the
   rest are short-circuited as `failed` with `skipped_reason: no_transcript`.
   Each grader updates the run's status to `graded` or `failed`.
4. **Refresh** — At the end of `run_all`, `_refresh_manifest_runs` walks
   every run dir, reads `run_status.json` + `timing.json` + `grading.json`,
   and rebuilds the manifest's per-run entries. Idempotent — safe to call
   multiple times.
